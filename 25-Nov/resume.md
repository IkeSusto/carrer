### Experience

**Data Analyst**
*Itaú | Internship | São Paulo, Brazil | January 2025 – Present | 11 months*

* **Process Optimization**: Decommissioned 7 out of 60 daily SQL/SAS routines through automation and process redesign, reducing manual workload by 30 minutes per day for mid-level analysts and improving operational efficiency.
* **Financial Impact Analysis**: Identified critical data inconsistencies revealing a gap in contractual fee payments worth R$500,000 monthly.
