### Experience

**Data Engineer/Data Analyst** (promoted to JR Data Engineer, Dec 2025)
*Itaú | Internship | São Paulo, Brazil | January 2025 – December 2025 | 12 months*

* **Process Optimization**: Decommissioned 7 out of 60 daily SQL/SAS routines through automation and process redesign, reducing manual workload by 30 minutes per day for mid-level analysts and improving operational efficiency.
* **Financial Impact Analysis**: Identified critical data inconsistencies revealing a gap in contractual fee payments worth R$500,000 monthly.
* **AWS Data Pipeline Development**: Design'ed and implemented an automated classification system using AWS Athena, Glue, and Step Functions to categorize payment gaps by reason, transforming ad-hoc manual analysis into systematic, actionable insights for business decision-making.
* **Data Integration Architecture**: Transformed fragmented and manual data movement challenges into an opportunity for impact by developing a standardized ETL pipeline (GlueLess) for seamless transfer from SharePoint files (CSV/XLSX) and legacy MS SQL Servers to AWS Athena using Glue/PySpark, achieving 42% cost reduction and 80% time savings for analysts.
* **Code Quality & Scalability**: Established reusable, team-specific components, eliminating code duplication and enabling rapid feature implementation without legacy code refactoring.

**Algebra and Geometry Teacher**
*CPE | Volunteer | São Paulo, Brazil | February 2024 – Present | 23 months*

Teach Geometry (2024) and Algebra (2025) at Cursinho Popular EACH USP - university entrance exam preparation course. Manage four weekly classes with 40+ students each tailored for ENEM and college entrance exam requirements.

### Projects

**GlueLess**
*Low-code Python library for seamless data integration between file sources, MS SQL Server, and AWS Glue | In expansion*
* Conceived, designed, and built GlueLess end-to-end as a solo project.
* Leveraged AWS cloud infrastructure to streamline and automate data movement from legacy systems to AWS, significantly simplifying workflows for clients and data analysts.
* Empowered users with a user-friendly interface, eliminating the need for specialized Python knowledge and reducing onboarding time.
* Reduced processing costs by 42% through optimized data transfer workflows and efficient resource utilization.
* Consolidated 30+ disparate data movement scripts into a unified, maintainable solution, reducing code duplication and technical debt.
* Enhanced team productivity by abstracting complex AWS Glue operations behind user-friendly abstractions while maintaining full configurability for advanced use cases.

**Bullet Hell**
*Shoot'em Up game refactored from procedural to object-oriented architecture | Completed*
* Redesigned game architecture applying OOP principles (inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism) to improve code maintainability and extensibility.
* Reduced code duplication by 60% and enabled easy addition of new enemy types and power-ups without modifying core game logic.

**Academic Management System**
*Web platform for attendance control, academic performance tracking and low engagement alerts for EACH USP’s prep course students | In progress*
